* 4 Tbsp butter
* 4 Tbsp flour
* 1 cup milk
* 1 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese
* Optional:
  * Cubed ham (1 cup) + 1 tsp of yellow mustard

## Instructions

* Cook 8 oz macaroni.
* In a large saucepan, melt **4 Tbsp** butter. 
* Add **4 Tbsp** flour, mixing until all butter is in the flour and "smooth". 
* Gradually add **1 cup** milk, making sure that all of the flour/butter mix is getting mixed into the milk. 
* Heat slowly until thickened. 
* Remove from heat, stir in cheese until melted. 
* Add cheese sauce to drained macaroni.

If desired, bake in the oven at 350F for 30-45 minutes. Serve hot.

## Notes

* Don't overcook the macaroni, or this will get really, really mushy while in the oven.
