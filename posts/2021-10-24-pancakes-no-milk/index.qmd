We have a kid that is lactose free, so we are always looking for ways to either make things without milk at all, or using a lactose free substitute.

Makes 15 - 20 pancakes, depending on how thin you make the batter.
We like ours thicker, I got 16 pancakes, which meant for the 5 of us, we had 2 pancakes left over.

## Ingredients

* 3 cups all-purpose flour
* 7 tsp baking powder
* 1 tsp salt (or just a shake)
* 4 Tbsp sugar
* 2 eggs
* 6 Tbsp margarine, melted
* 3 tsp vanilla
* 2 Â½ cups water

## Directions

* In a large bowl, sift together the **3 cups** of flour, **7 tsp** of baking powder, salt, and **3 Tbsp** of sugar.
* Make a well in the middle, and pour in **2** eggs, **6 Tbsp** melted margarine, and **2 tsp** vanilla.
* Pour in **1 cup** of water and begin stirring together with a whisk.
* Slowly add more water while whisking until you have all the lumps out of it, and add water to your desired consistency.
* If you have addins like mashed bananas and chocolate chips, now is the time to add them. I've easily added 2 mashed bananas to this recipe without issue.

* Lightly grease a frying pan (neutral oil spread with paper towel will work), and heat to medium high.
* Pour a large spoonful of batter on, and wait for bubbles to form before flipping.
