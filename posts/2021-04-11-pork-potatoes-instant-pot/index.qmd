## Ingredients

* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 5 (1-inch to 1 1/2-inch thick) boneless pork chops
* 1/2 teaspoon black pepper (divided)
* 1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder (divided)
* 1 teaspoon Kosher salt
* 1 cup onion (chopped)
* 1 1/2 cups chicken broth
* 1 1/2 pounds potatoes (cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces)
* 1 1/2 teaspoons rosemary (chopped, or about 1/2 teaspoon dried chopped)
* 1 1/2 teaspoons thyme leaves (or about 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme)

## Directions

* Choose the Instant Pot saut√© setting (normal) and add the olive oil. * When the pot display reads "hot," rub the chops with half of the pepper, 1/2 teaspoon of the garlic powder, and about 1/2
teaspoon of kosher salt. 
* Cook the pork chops for about 3 minutes on each side. 
* If your pork chops are large, you may have to do this in two batches. 
* Remove the chops to a plate and set aside.

* Add the **1 cup** chopped onion to the pot. 
* Cook the onion for about 2 minutes and then add **1 1/2 cups** chicken broth; stir to loosen any browned bits.

* Return chops to pot.
* Place a steaming basket or foil-lined trivet on top of the pork chops; 
* toss the potatoes with the remaining black pepper and garlic powder along with the rosemary, thyme
and 1/2 teaspoon of the kosher salt, and add potatoes on top. 
* If using a foil lined trivet, make sure you have lots of holes in the foil so the potatoes will cook.

* Secure the Instant Pot lid and make sure the valve is in the sealing position. 
* Choose pressure cook or manual (high pressure) and set the timer for 5 minutes. 
* When the time is up, let the pressure come down naturally for 10 minutes and then move the valve to the venting position to release the remaining pressure.
