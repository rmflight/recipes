## Preparation Time

* Prep time: 15 - 20 min to prep the filling (outside of the shredded chicken breast).
* Bake time: 30 - 40 min.
* Resting: 10 min.

## Ingredients

* 2 cups of shredded chicken breast
  * I like [this method](https://rmflight.github.io/recipes/posts/2021-11-06-poached-chicken-breast-instant-pot) of cooking chicken breast for this.
* 2 prepared pie crusts, room temperature
* 1 Tbsp oil
* 3 large carrots, chopped (2 cups)
* 1 Tbsp minced onion
* 1 tsp minced garlic
* 1/3 cup butter
* 1/3 cup flour
* 1 3/4 cup chicken stock
  * I'll be honest, I take 2 heaping teaspoons (teaspoon from my cutlery drawer) of dried chicken stock mix into 1 3/4 water for this.
* 1/2 cup milk
* salt and pepper to taste
* 1 tsp rubbed or dried sage / summer savory
* 1/2 cup frozen peas

## Directions

* Make sure your pie crust is at room temperature.

* Dice **3 large** carrots (2 cups).

* Cook carrots, onion and garlic
  * Heat **1 Tbsp** oil in a skillet over medium-high heat.
  * When oil is hot, add carrots, cook for 5 minutes, until they take on color and start to soften.
  * Add **1 Tbsp** minced onion and **1 tsp** garlic, cook for just a little longer.
* While veggies are cooking, in another pot make the sauce 
  * Melt **1/3 cup** butter over medium heat.
  * Add **1/3 cup** flour and mix into the butter, heating through.
  * Add **1 3/4 cup** chicken stock and **1/2 cup** milk, stirring with a whisk.
  * Continue heating and stirring until sauce begins to thicken.
  * Add **1 tsp** sage / summer savory, salt and pepper to taste.
* Combine sauce, vegetables, **2 cups** of chicken, and **1/2 cup** of peas.

* Grease or spray a pie pan and put one pie crust in.

* Cover with the second pie crust.
* Poke holes in the second pie crust.
* Cover edges of pie crust with aluminum foil all around the pan.
* Bake at 425 for 20 minutes.
* Remove aluminum foil from pie crust edges.
