## Notes:

Yes, I use vegetable broth.
My digestive system does not seem to do well with the dried broth when you add enough powder to make it taste chickeny enough, and the same for "Better than Boullion".
If you really want chicken broth, go for it.
In my experience, the vegetable broth tasted great.
