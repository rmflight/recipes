## Ingredients

* 4 Tbsp Balsamic vinegar
* 1.5 Tbsp soy sauce
* 1 Tbsp brown sugar
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1/4 tsp dried thyme
* 1 1/4 lbs boneless, skinless chicken breast cut into small pieces
* 1 pinch salt and pepper
* 1 Tbsp olive oil
* 16 oz or 1 lb white mushrooms
* 2 Tbsp butter

## Directions

* Prepare the balsamic sauce first. 
* In a small bowl, stir together **4 Tbsp** balsamic vinegar, **1.5 Tbsp** soy sauce, **1 Tbsp** brown sugar, **2 cloves** (or 2 tsp) minced garlic, and **1/4 tsp** dried thyme. 
* Set the sauce aside.

* Heat a large skillet over medium. 
* Once hot, add the olive oil and swirl to coat the surface. 
* Add the pieces of chicken breast to the skillet and cook browned and cooked through. 
* Remove the chicken to a clean plate and cover to keep warm.

* While the chicken is cooking, clean **16 oz** of mushrooms and then slice the bigger ones in half. 
* After removing the chicken from the skillet, add the mushrooms in their place, and saut√© in the remaining oil and fat until the mushrooms are slightly tender and browned on the outside (5-7 minutes).

* Turn the heat down to medium-low. 
* Add the prepared balsamic sauce to the skillet and stir to dissolve any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. 
* Add chicken back to the skillet.
* Allow the sauce to come up to a simmer. 
* Simmer the balsamic sauce with the chicken & mushrooms, stirring occasionally, for about 5 minutes, or until the sauce has reduced by half.
* Add the butter to the skillet and stir until it is melted into the sauce.
