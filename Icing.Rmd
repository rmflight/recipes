## Chocolate Icing

### Ingredients

* 1 cup icing sugar (also known as confectioners sugar)
* 3 tbsp cocoa
* 2 tbsp butter
* 2 tsp vanilla
* 1 - 3 tsp water

### Lactose Free

For a lactose free option, you can replace the **2 tbsp** butter with **2 tbsp** of margarine, and you will only need **1 tsp** of water.

### Directions

* Combine dry ingredients and butter into a bowl.
* Mix using a hand-mixer on low speed.
* Add water **1 tsp** at a time, adding it and then mixing.
  * This is especially important when using margarine, as it has more water than the butter.
