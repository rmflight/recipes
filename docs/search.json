Set aside.\nSeason 2 - 4 pork chops with a sprinkling of salt and pepper on each side. Go lightly on the pepper. Set aside while pot warms up.\nTurn the IP to Sauté mode (Normal heat). When the display reads “Hot” add 1 Tbsp oil to the pot.\nAdd the pork chops, two at a time, and brown on each side for about 4 minutes per side (less if thin). Remove to a plate and set aside.\nAdd the onion and 1 Tbsp water. Cook the onion, stirring frequently and scraping to deglaze the pot (get all of the brown bits off the bottom). I like to use a wooden spoon.\nWhen the onions are translucent and tender, add the 4 Tbsp butter and stir until melted.\nAdd the apples and 1/4 cup water. Stir well.\nAdd the pork chops (and any juices on the plate) back in and just set them on top of the apples. Don’t stir.\nPut the lid on the pot and set the steam release knob to the Sealing position. Cancel the Sauté mode.\nPress the Manual (or Pressure Cook) button and then the + or - button to select 10 (8 minutes for thinner chops) minutes.\n\nYes, the pot will come to pressure with only 1/4 cup of water in it. This is because the apples will release water as the pot is heating up and building pressure, so you will be okay. It’s the same for making applesauce!\n\nWhile the pork chops are cooking, mix together the 4 Tbsp brown sugar, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, and a pinch of salt. Set aside.\nWhen the cook cycle ends and the pot beeps, don’t do anything to it, just let it naturally release pressure for 10 minutes (the counter will begin counting up).\nAfter the 10 minutes is up, turn the steam release knob to manually release the remaining pressure. When the pin in the lid drops, open the lid. Remove the pork chops to a plate and cover with foil or a lid to keep warm.\nTurn the Sauté mode back on.\nAdd the brown sugar mixture to the apple mixture and stir.\nMix the 2 Tbsp corn starch with 3 Tbsp cold water. Stir the corn starch slurry into the apple mixture, stirring constantly.\nWhen the mixture thickens, turn off the pot. Remove apple gravy to a serving bowl immediately.\nServe the pork chops smothered in the warm apple gravy. Yum!\n\nFrom https://www.simplyhappyfoodie.com/instant-pot-autumn-apple-pork-chops/"

However, we are talking changes of 1 - 2 minutes, in salty water.\nI use this to make shredded chicken breast for soup, chicken pot pie, etc.\nOriginal guidelines are from Amy & Jacky Pressure Cook Recipes."

    "text": "Butter Substitutes\nWe have one child who is rather severely lactose intolerant, as in they can’t consume regular milk, yogurt or cheese. Even the brand of lactose free milk can make a difference, as it seems some are better at adding enough lactase enzyme over others. Pro-tip, Lactaid brand seems fine, as does the Aldi and Walmart brand lactose free milks. Kroger brand is not fine, at least in our family.\nTherefore, we use plant based butter substitutes in almost all of our recipes, unless the recipe also includes cheese, in which case we don’t bother.\nHowever, depending on what exactly is being cooked, in my experience it seems that different butter substitutes are more appropriate, factoring in taste, extra water added, etc.\nI shop at our local WalMart, so this is all based on what I can buy there.\n\nGreat Value Unsalted Butter: goes in my coffee (yes, I like butter in my coffee), and also used in the cheese sauce for my Mac & Cheese.\nCountry Crock Plant Butter: In cookies, cakes and muffins, this is a straight substitute. However, this does not work for buttercream icing, roux, or bread dough based recipes like cinnamon buns. In the case of a roux, the butter taste is too strong. Buttercream icing ends up with a weird consistency. Bread dough doesn’t seem to rise properly.\nSmart Balance Buttery Spread: This one I use when I’m making a dairy free or lactose free roux, like for our Chicken Pot Pie, and we also use in bread doughs and buttercream icing."
