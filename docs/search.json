Set over high heat, cover and bring to a boil.\nOnce boiling, uncover, decrease the heat to maintain a simmer and cook until tender and easily crushed with tongs, approximately 10 to 15 minutes.\nPlace the half-and-half and butter into a microwave-safe container and heat in the microwave until warmed through, about 35 seconds.\nDrain the potatoes in a colander and then return to the saucepan.\nMash the potatoes and then add the 1/4 cup milk, 2 oz butter, salt and pepper and continue to mash until smooth.\nStir in the egg yolk until well combined.\n\n\n\nFilling\n\nWhile the potatoes are cooking, prepare the filling.\nPlace the 1 Tbsp canola oil into a 12-inch saute pan and set over medium high heat.\nOnce the oil shimmers, add the 2 Tbsp minced onion and 3 cubed carrots and saute just until they begin to take on color, approximately 3 to 4 minutes.\nAdd the 2 cloves garlic and stir to combine.\nAdd the 1 1/2 lbs hamburger, salt and pepper and cook until browned and cooked through.\nSprinkle the meat with the 2 Tbsp flour and toss to coat, continuing to cook for another minute.\nAdd the 2 tsp tomato paste, 1 1/2 cups chicken broth, 1 tsp Worcestershire, 1 tsp rosemary, 1 tsp thyme, and stir to combine.\nBring to a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer slowly 10 to 12 minutes or until the sauce is thickened slightly.\nAdd 1/2 cup peas to the hamburger mixture.\n\n\n\nCombine Them\n\nSpread meat filling into a greased baking dish.\nTop with the mashed potatoes, starting around the edges to create a seal to prevent the mixture from bubbling up and smooth with a rubber spatula.\nPlace on a parchment lined half sheet pan on the middle rack of the oven and bake at 400 F for 25 minutes or just until the potatoes begin to brown.\nRemove to a cooling rack for at least 15 minutes before serving.\n\nAdapted from Alton Brown’s Shepherds Pie: https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/shepherds-pie-recipe2-1942900"

    "text": "Butter Substitutes\nWe have one child who is rather severely lactose intolerant, as in they can’t consume regular milk, yogurt or cheese. Even the brand of lactose free milk can make a difference, as it seems some are better at adding enough lactase enzyme over others. Pro-tip, Lactaid brand seems fine, as does the Aldi and Walmart brand lactose free milks. Kroger brand is not fine, at least in our family.\nTherefore, we use plant based butter substitutes in almost all of our recipes, unless the recipe also includes cheese, in which case we don’t bother.\nHowever, depending on what exactly is being cooked, in my experience it seems that different butter substitutes are more appropriate, factoring in taste, extra water added, etc.\nI shop at our local WalMart, so this is all based on what I can buy there.\n\nGreat Value Unsalted Butter: goes in my coffee (yes, I like butter in my coffee), and also used in the cheese sauce for my Mac & Cheese.\nCountry Crock Plant Butter: In cookies, cakes and muffins, this is a straight substitute. However, this does not work for buttercream icing, roux, or bread dough based recipes like cinnamon buns. In the case of a roux, the butter taste is too strong. Buttercream icing ends up with a weird consistency. Bread dough doesn’t seem to rise properly.\nSmart Balance Buttery Spread: This one I use when I’m making a dairy free or lactose free roux, like for our Chicken Pot Pie, and we also use in bread doughs and buttercream icing."

Set aside.\nSeason 2 - 4 pork chops with a sprinkling of salt and pepper on each side. Go lightly on the pepper. Set aside while pot warms up.\nTurn the IP to Sauté mode (Normal heat). When the display reads “Hot” add 1 Tbsp oil to the pot.\nAdd the pork chops, two at a time, and brown on each side for about 4 minutes per side (less if thin). Remove to a plate and set aside.\nAdd the onion and 1 Tbsp water. Cook the onion, stirring frequently and scraping to deglaze the pot (get all of the brown bits off the bottom). I like to use a wooden spoon.\nWhen the onions are translucent and tender, add the 4 Tbsp butter and stir until melted.\nAdd the apples and 1/4 cup water. Stir well.\nAdd the pork chops (and any juices on the plate) back in and just set them on top of the apples. Don’t stir.\nPut the lid on the pot and set the steam release knob to the Sealing position. Cancel the Sauté mode.\nPress the Manual (or Pressure Cook) button and then the + or - button to select 10 (8 minutes for thinner chops) minutes.\n\nYes, the pot will come to pressure with only 1/4 cup of water in it. This is because the apples will release water as the pot is heating up and building pressure, so you will be okay. It’s the same for making applesauce!\n\nWhile the pork chops are cooking, mix together the 4 Tbsp brown sugar, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, and a pinch of salt. Set aside.\nWhen the cook cycle ends and the pot beeps, don’t do anything to it, just let it naturally release pressure for 10 minutes (the counter will begin counting up).\nAfter the 10 minutes is up, turn the steam release knob to manually release the remaining pressure. When the pin in the lid drops, open the lid. Remove the pork chops to a plate and cover with foil or a lid to keep warm.\nTurn the Sauté mode back on.\nAdd the brown sugar mixture to the apple mixture and stir.\nMix the 2 Tbsp corn starch with 3 Tbsp cold water. Stir the corn starch slurry into the apple mixture, stirring constantly.\nWhen the mixture thickens, turn off the pot. Remove apple gravy to a serving bowl immediately.\nServe the pork chops smothered in the warm apple gravy. Yum!\n\nFrom https://www.simplyhappyfoodie.com/instant-pot-autumn-apple-pork-chops/"

    "text": "Directions\n\nBeat the 1/2 cup butter, 1/2 cup granulated white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar together on medium high speed until fluffy and light in color, about 2-3 minutes.\nAdd the 1 egg and 1/2 tsp vanilla extract, and then beat on high speed until combined. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed.\nIn a separate bowl, whisk the 1 cup flour, 2/3 cup cocoa powder, 1 tsp baking soda together until combined.\nWith the mixer running on low speed, slowly pour into the wet ingredients.\nBeat on low until combined. The cookie dough will be quite thick.\nSwitch to high speed and beat in the 1 tbsp milk, and then the 1 1/4 cup chocolate chips. The cookie dough will be sticky and tacky.\nCover dough tightly and chill in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours and up to 3 days. Chilling is mandatory for this sticky cookie dough.\nRemove cookie dough from the refrigerator and allow to sit at room temperature for 10 minutes. If the cookie dough chilled longer than 3 hours, let it sit at room temperature for about 20 minutes. This makes the chilled cookie dough easier to scoop and roll.\nPreheat oven to 350°F. Line large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.\nScoop and roll dough, a heaping 1.5 tbsp in size, into balls. To ensure a thicker cookie, make the balls taller than they are wide (almost like a cylinder or column).\nArrange 2-3 inches apart on the baking sheets. The cookie dough is certainly sticky, so wipe your hands clean after every few balls of dough you shape.\nBake the cookies for 11-12 minutes or until the edges appear set and the centers still look soft. Tip: If they aren’t really spreading by minute 9, remove them from the oven and lightly bang the baking sheet on the counter 2-3x. This helps initiate that spread. Return to the oven to continue baking.\nCool cookies for 5 minutes on the baking sheet. Transfer to a cooling rack to finish cooling.\n\nFrom Sally’s Baking Recipes"

This means that the more cold chicken breast you put in, the more heat it will take to get it to pressure, and therefore you need less time to naturally release. However, we are talking changes of 1 - 2 minutes, in salty water.\nI use this to make shredded chicken breast for soup, chicken pot pie, etc.\nOriginal guidelines are from Amy & Jacky Pressure Cook Recipes."

Cut a corner off the bottom of the bag and pipe the batter into each donut cup, filling about halfway.\nBake for 10-11 minutes or until the edges and tops are lightly browned. To test, poke your finger into the top of the donut. If the donut bounces back, they’re done.\nCool donuts for 2 minutes then transfer to a wire rack. Re-grease the pan and bake the remaining donut batter.\nCoat the donuts:\n\nCombine the 1 cup white sugar, 3/4 tsp cinnamon, 3/4 tsp apple pie spice together in a medium bowl.\nMelt 6 tbsp butter.\n\nOnce cool enough to handle, dunk both sides of each donut in the melted butter, then generously in the apple spice topping.\n\nFrom Sally’s Baking Addiction."

Combine rest of ingredients as above.\nIf desired, 1lb of browned ground beef can be added before serving over noodles or using in other pasta recipes.\n\n\nNutritional Info\n780 kcal (full) or 390 kcal (half), over 16 or 8 servings, is 50 kcal / serving.\nWith 80/20 ground beef added, (1 or 0.5 lb), you add another 70 kcal / serving.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nFlight, Robert M. 2021. “Flight Family Recipes: Lasagna.” https://rmflight.github.io/recipes/posts/2021-03-14-lasagna/."

(The batter may look a little grainy – that’s okay).\nWith the mixer on low, add the flour mixture in three separate additions, alternating with the milk and ending with the flour.\nToss the strawberries with 2 tsp of flour (this will keep them from sinking to the bottom).\nAdd the berries to the batter and fold with a spatula until evenly distributed. Do not overmix.\nScoop the batter into the prepared muffin tin (an ice-cream scoop with a wire scraper works well here); they will be very full.\nBake at 375F for about 30 minutes, until lightly golden and a cake tester comes out clean.\nRun a sharp knife around the top edge of each muffin to free it from the pan if necessary (the edges can stick), then let the muffins cool in the pan for about 25 minutes. Transfer the muffins to a rack to cool completely.\n\nFrom Once Upon a Chef."

    "text": "Directions\n\nPut a largish bowl on your kitchen scale, turn the scale to grams (g) and zero / tare it so the scale reads zero.\nMeasure 5 cups of bread flour into the bowl. Note the weight!\nWhatever the weight in grams of flour, multiply by 0.65 to get the amount of water you want.\n\nFor example, your flour weight was 600 grams, then you want \\(600g \\times 0.65 = 390g\\) of warm (100 - 110F) water.\n\nGet another bowl, zero / tare your scale.\nAdd the required amount of warm (100 - 110F) water.\nDump water into mixing bowl.\nAdd 1 Tbsp white sugar, and 1 package of fast rising yeast.\nMix together.\nLet sit for 5 minutes.\nAdd 1 Tbsp oil, a little salt, and previously measured bread flour.\nUsing paddle, mix until flour and water are just combined.\nLet sit for 5 minutes.\nSwitch to dough hook, scrape any dough off the paddle, and knead for 5 minutes on low.\nThe dough should not be sticking to the sides at all when it’s done kneading.\nScrape any remaining dough off the sides of the bowl, lightly grease the mixing bowl, coat the dough slightly, and cover to rise for at least 90 minutes.\nOn a clean surface, put out flour or corn meal.\nPress out your dough to desired shape, either with hands or rolling pin. It will be tough to work (at least in my experience).\nAdd pizza toppings.\nBake at 425F for 12 minutes."
