# Pork and Apples (Instant Pot)

* 3 Apples sliced about 1/4" thick
* 1 Small Sweet Onion (Walla Walla, Vidalia, etc) Cut in half and thinly sliced.
* 2-4 Pork Chops 
* Salt
* Pepper
* 1 Tbsp Vegetable Oil
* 1/4 cup Plus 1 Tbsp Water (divided)
* 4 Tbsp Butter (unsalted)
* 4 Tbsp Brown Sugar
* 1/4 tsp Cinnamon
* 1/4 tsp Nutmeg
* Pinch of Salt
* 2 Tbsp Corn Starch
* 3 Tbsp Cold Water

Prepare apples by peeling, coring, and slicing. Set aside.
Remove the outer skin of the onion. Cut in half and slice thinly (You will have half circles). Set aside.
Season the pork chops with a sprinkling of salt and pepper on each side. Go lightly on the pepper. Set aside while pot warms up.

Turn the IP to Sauté mode (Normal heat). When the display reads "Hot" add the oil to the pot.
Add the pork chops, two at a time, and brown on each side for about 4 minutes per side. Remove to a plate and set aside.
Add the onion and 1 Tbsp water. Cook the onion, stirring frequently and scraping to deglaze the pot (get all of the brown bits off the bottom). I like to use a wooden spoon.

When the onions are translucent and tender, add the butter and stir until melted.
Add the apples and 1/4 cup water. Stir well.
Add the pork chops (and any juices on the plate) back in and just set them on top of the apples. Don't stir. 

Put the lid on the pot and set the steam release knob to the Sealing position. Cancel the Sauté mode.
Press the Manual (or Pressure Cook) button and then the + or - button to select 10 (8 minutes for thinner chops) minutes.
***Yes, the pot will come to pressure with only 1/4 cup of water in it. This is because the apples will release water as the pot is heating up and building pressure, so you will be okay. It's the same for making applesauce!

While the pork chops are cooking, mix together the brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and a pinch of salt. Set aside.
When the cook cycle ends and the pot beeps, don't do anything to it, just let it naturally release pressure for 10 minutes (the counter will begin counting up). After the 10 minutes is up, turn the steam release knob to manually release the remaining pressure.
When the pin in the lid drops, open the lid. Remove the pork chops to a plate and cover with foil or a lid to keep warm.

Turn the Sauté mode back on.
Add the brown sugar mixture to the apple mixture and stir.
Mix the corn starch with the cold water. Stir the corn starch slurry into the apple mixture, stirring constantly.
When the mixture thickens, turn off the pot. Remove apple gravy to a serving bowl immediately.
Serve the pork chops smothered in the warm apple gravy. Yum!

# Balsamic Chicken & Mushrooms

* 4 Tbsp golden balsamic vinegar
* 1.5 Tbsp soy sauce
* 1 Tbsp brown sugar
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1/4 tsp dried thyme
* 1 1/4 lbs boneless, skinless chicken breast cut into small pieces
* 1 pinch salt and pepper
* 1 Tbsp olive oil ($0.16)
* 16 oz or 1 lb mushrooms
* 2 Tbsp butter ($0.26)

## Directions

Prepare the balsamic sauce first. 
In a small bowl, stir together the balsamic vinegar, soy sauce, brown sugar, minced garlic, and dried thyme. 
Set the sauce aside.

Heat a large skillet over medium. 
Once hot, add the olive oil and swirl to coat the surface. 
Add the pieces of chicken breast to the skillet and cook browned and cooked through. 
Remove the chicken to a clean plate and cover to keep warm.

While the chicken is cooking, clean the mushrooms and then slice them in half. 
After removing the chicken from the skillet, add the mushrooms in their place, and sauté in the remaining oil and fat until the mushrooms are slightly tender and browned on the outside (5-7 minutes).

Turn the heat down to medium-low. 
Add the prepared balsamic sauce to the skillet and stir to dissolve any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. 
Allow the sauce to come up to a simmer. 
Simmer the balsamic sauce with the mushrooms, stirring occasionally, for about 5 minutes, or until the sauce has reduced by half.
Add the butter to the skillet and stir until it is melted into the sauce. 
Add the chicken back to the skillet, turning it to coat in the sauce, and allow it to simmer for a few minutes more to rewarm the chicken. 
Serve hot.

# Pork & Potatoes (Instant Pot)

* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 5 (1-inch to 1 1/2-inch thick) boneless pork chops
* 1/2 teaspoon black pepper (divided)
* 1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder (divided)
* 1 teaspoon Kosher salt
* 1 cup onion (chopped)
* 1 1/2 cups chicken broth
* 1 1/2 pounds potatoes (cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces)
* 1 1/2 teaspoons rosemary (chopped, or about 1/2 teaspoon dried chopped)
* 1 1/2 teaspoons thyme leaves (or about 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme)

## Directions

Choose the Instant Pot sauté setting (normal) and add the olive oil. 
When the pot display reads "hot," rub the chops with half of the pepper, 1/2 teaspoon of the garlic powder, and about 1/2
teaspoon of kosher salt. 
Cook the pork chops for about 3 minutes on each side. 
If your pork chops are large, you may have to do this in two batches. 
Remove the chops to a plate and set aside.

Add the chopped onion to the pot. 
Cook the onion for about 2 minutes and then add the chicken broth; stir to loosen any browned bits.

Return chops to pot.

Place a steaming basket or foil-lined trivet on top of the pork chops; 
toss the potatoes with the remaining black pepper and garlic powder along with the rosemary, thyme
and 1/2 teaspoon of the kosher salt, and add potatoes on top. 
If using a foil lined trivet, make sure you have lots of holes in the foil so the potatoes will cook.

Secure the Instant Pot lid and make sure the valve is in the sealing position. 
Choose pressure cook or manual (high pressure) and set the timer for 5 minutes. 
When the time is up, let the pressure come down naturally for 10 minutes and then move the valve to the venting position to release the remaining pressure.
