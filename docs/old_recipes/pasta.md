# Mac And Cheese

v 0.0.1

* macaroni noodles - 8 ounces cooked just al-dente
* Butter - 4 Tbsp
* Flour - 4 Tbsp
* Milk - 1 cup + a *bit* more
* Cheddar cheese - 1 & 1/2 cups shredded (adjust depending on how cheesy you like it)
* Optional:
  * Cubed ham (1 cup) + 1 tsp of yellow mustard

## Instructions

Cook macaroni.

In a large saucepan, melt butter. Add flour, mixing until all butter is in the flour and "smooth". Gradually add milk, making sure that all of the flour/butter mix is getting mixed into the milk. Heat slowly until thickened. Remove from heat, stir in cheese until melted. Add cheese sauce to drained macaroni.

If desired, bake in the oven at 350F for 30-45 minutes. Serve hot.

## Notes

Don't overcook the macaroni, or this will get really, really mushy while in the oven.
