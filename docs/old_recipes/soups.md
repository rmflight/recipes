# Crosby's Baked Beans (Instant Pot)

* 2 cups dried navy or pea beans
* 1 small onion, peeled
* One small apple, peeled and cored
* 1/3 cup brown sugar
* ½ cup Crosby’s Fancy Molasses
* 1 tsp. salt
* 1 ½ tsp. dried mustard
* ½ Tbsp. Worcestershire sauce
* ½ tsp. freshly ground black pepper
* Boiling water

Place your dried beans in the instant pot and cover with an inch of water (about 4 cups).
Secure the lid, turn the pot’s steam vent to close. On manual mode, set the timer for 15 minutes.

While the beans are cooking, combine brown sugar, molasses, salt, dried mustard, Worcestershire, and black pepper in a bowl.
Add two cups of boiling water and stir to combine.

When the timer beeps, allow the pot to depressurize for about 20 minutes, press “cancel” and then carefully turn the steam vent to open and remove the lid.
Drain the beans well and return them to the pot.

Bury the onion and apple in the beans and pour molasses mixture over the beans.
Secure the lid, turn the steam vent to close, and set the timer for 16 minutes.
When the 16 minutes are up (timer beeps), allow your pot to depressurize another 20 minutes, turn steam vent to open and remove lid.
If you’re beans are too runny, turn unit to saute mode and saute for 5-7 minutes, stirring from time to time.
