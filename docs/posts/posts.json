(It should be around 110°F — I recommend measuring the temperature with a cooking thermometer.)\nIf the mixture is too hot, just wait a few minutes for it to cool.\nIn a separate bowl, whisk together 3 cups flour, 1/4 cup granulated sugar and 1/2 tsp salt until combined.\nIn the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough-hook attachment, add the warm milk mixture and sprinkle the 1 package yeast on top, then give the mixture a brief stir.\nAdd the flour mixture and 1 egg, and beat on medium-low speed until combined.\nIf the dough is sticking to the sides of the bowl, add the 1/2 cup of flour, 1/4 cup at a time, until the dough begins to form a ball and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. (Use no more than 3 1/2 cups of flour total.)\nContinue beating for 5 minutes on medium-low speed.\nRemove dough and form it into a ball with your hands.\nPlace it in a greased bowl and cover with a damp towel.\nLet rest for 20 minutes or doubled in size.\nFilling\n1/4 cup packed brown sugar\n1/4 cup white sugar\n2 Tbsp ground cinnamon\nWhile the dough rests, make your filling by whisking together 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar and 2 Tbsp ground cinnamon together in a small mixing bowl until combined.\nRoll Out Dough\n1/4 cup butter (sofened)\nOnce the dough is ready, turn it out onto a floured work surface.\nUse a floured rolling pin to roll the dough out into a large rectangle, about 9 x 14 inches in size. (If you want all of the edges to be even, you can use a pizza slicer to cut the dough into an even rectangle.)\nUse a knife or an offset spatula to spread the remaining 1/4 cup of softened butter out evenly over the entire surface of the dough.\nThen sprinkle the dough evenly with the cinnamon and sugar mixture.\nBeginning at the 14-inch edge, tightly roll up the dough and give the final seam a little pinch so that it seals.\nUse a piece of dental floss or a knife to slice off the two ends of the roll (just 1/2-inch or so on each end, which you can discard) so that the ends are even.\nCut the remaining dough into 11 or 12 equal pieces. (11 rolls fit well in a pie plate, whereas 12 rolls fit in a rectangular pan.)\nPlace each of the cut cinnamon rolls into a greased 9-inch pie plate or 9 x 13-inch baking dish.\nCover the dish with a damp towel, and leave it in a warm place to rise for 25 minutes.\nHeat the oven to 350°F.\nOnce the rolls have risen, uncover the dish.\nPlace on the center rack of the oven and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the rolls are golden and cooked through.\nRemove and let cool on a wire rack for at least 5 minutes.\nCream Cheese Icing\n4 ounces (1/2 cup) cream cheese, softened\n3 Tbsp butter, softened\n1 tsp vanilla extract\n1 1/2 cups powdered sugar\n1–2 Tbsp milk (if needed)\nWhisk ingredients together in a mixing bowl. Drizzle on cinnamon rolls while still warm.\nTraditional Icing\n1/4 cup butter, melted\n1 tsp vanilla extract\n1 1/2 cup powdered sugar\n1–2 tablespoons milk\nWhisk ingredients together in a mixing bowl. Drizzle on cinnamon rolls while still warm.\nOriginally sourced from Gimme Some Oven 1 hour Cinnamon Rolls\n\n\n\n",
