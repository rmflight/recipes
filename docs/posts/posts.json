My digestive system does not seem to do well with the dried broth when you add enough powder to make it taste chickeny enough, and the same for “Better than Boullion”. If you really want chicken broth, go for it. In my experience, the vegetable broth tasted great, especially if you add the chicken before letting it simmer.\n\n\n\n",

This means that the more cold chicken breast you put in, the more heat it will take to get it to pressure, and therefore you need less time to naturally release.

Set aside.\nRemove the outer skin of 1 small sweet onion. Cut in half and slice thinly (You will have half circles). Set aside.\nSeason 2 - 4 pork chops with a sprinkling of salt and pepper on each side. Go lightly on the pepper. Set aside while pot warms up.\nTurn the IP to Sauté mode (Normal heat). When the display reads “Hot” add 1 Tbsp oil to the pot.\nAdd the pork chops, two at a time, and brown on each side for about 4 minutes per side (less if thin). Remove to a plate and set aside.\nAdd the onion and 1 Tbsp water. Cook the onion, stirring frequently and scraping to deglaze the pot (get all of the brown bits off the bottom). I like to use a wooden spoon.\nWhen the onions are translucent and tender, add the 4 Tbsp butter and stir until melted.\nAdd the apples and 1/4 cup water. Stir well.\nAdd the pork chops (and any juices on the plate) back in and just set them on top of the apples. Don’t stir.\nPut the lid on the pot and set the steam release knob to the Sealing position. Cancel the Sauté mode.\nPress the Manual (or Pressure Cook) button and then the + or - button to select 10 (8 minutes for thinner chops) minutes.\nYes, the pot will come to pressure with only 1/4 cup of water in it. This is because the apples will release water as the pot is heating up and building pressure, so you will be okay. It’s the same for making applesauce!\nWhile the pork chops are cooking, mix together the 4 Tbsp brown sugar, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, and a pinch of salt. Set aside.\nWhen the cook cycle ends and the pot beeps, don’t do anything to it, just let it naturally release pressure for 10 minutes (the counter will begin counting up).\nAfter the 10 minutes is up, turn the steam release knob to manually release the remaining pressure. When the pin in the lid drops, open the lid. Remove the pork chops to a plate and cover with foil or a lid to keep warm.\nTurn the Sauté mode back on.\nAdd the brown sugar mixture to the apple mixture and stir.\nMix the 2 Tbsp corn starch with 3 Tbsp cold water. Stir the corn starch slurry into the apple mixture, stirring constantly.\nWhen the mixture thickens, turn off the pot. Remove apple gravy to a serving bowl immediately.\nServe the pork chops smothered in the warm apple gravy. Yum!\nFrom https://www.simplyhappyfoodie.com/instant-pot-autumn-apple-pork-chops/\n\n\n\n",

(It should be around 110°F — I recommend measuring the temperature with a cooking thermometer.)\nIf the mixture is too hot, just wait a few minutes for it to cool.\nIn a separate bowl, whisk together 3 cups flour, 1/4 cup granulated sugar and 1/2 tsp salt until combined.\nIn the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough-hook attachment, add the warm milk mixture and sprinkle the 1 package yeast on top, then give the mixture a brief stir.\nAdd the flour mixture and 1 egg, and beat on medium-low speed until combined.\nIf the dough is sticking to the sides of the bowl, add the 1/2 cup of flour, 1/4 cup at a time, until the dough begins to form a ball and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. (Use no more than 3 1/2 cups of flour total.)\nContinue beating for 5 minutes on medium-low speed.\nRemove dough and form it into a ball with your hands.\nPlace it in a greased bowl and cover with a damp towel.\nLet rest for 20 minutes or doubled in size.\nFilling\n1/4 cup packed brown sugar\n1/4 cup white sugar\n2 Tbsp ground cinnamon\nWhile the dough rests, make your filling by whisking together 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar and 2 Tbsp ground cinnamon together in a small mixing bowl until combined.\nRoll Out Dough\n1/4 cup butter (sofened)\nOnce the dough is ready, turn it out onto a floured work surface.\nUse a floured rolling pin to roll the dough out into a large rectangle, about 9 x 14 inches in size. (If you want all of the edges to be even, you can use a pizza slicer to cut the dough into an even rectangle.)\nUse a knife or an offset spatula to spread the remaining 1/4 cup of softened butter out evenly over the entire surface of the dough.\nThen sprinkle the dough evenly with the cinnamon and sugar mixture.\nBeginning at the 14-inch edge, tightly roll up the dough and give the final seam a little pinch so that it seals.\nUse a piece of dental floss or a knife to slice off the two ends of the roll (just 1/2-inch or so on each end, which you can discard) so that the ends are even.\nCut the remaining dough into 11 or 12 equal pieces. (11 rolls fit well in a pie plate, whereas 12 rolls fit in a rectangular pan.)\nPlace each of the cut cinnamon rolls into a greased 9-inch pie plate or 9 x 13-inch baking dish.\nCover the dish with a damp towel, and leave it in a warm place to rise for 25 minutes.\nHeat the oven to 350°F.\nOnce the rolls have risen, uncover the dish.\nPlace on the center rack of the oven and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the rolls are golden and cooked through.\nRemove and let cool on a wire rack for at least 5 minutes.\nNutritional Info\n2700 kCal total, assuming 13 / 14 servings, 200 kCal / bun.\nCream Cheese Icing\n4 ounces (1/2 cup) cream cheese, softened\n3 Tbsp butter, softened\n1 tsp vanilla extract\n1 1/2 cups powdered sugar\n1–2 Tbsp milk (if needed)\nWhisk ingredients together in a mixing bowl.
